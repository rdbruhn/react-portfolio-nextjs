My last post was right after my first technical interview with Hack Reactor. Well, I was not accepted on my first attempt, _but_ they told me to study up and apply again in about two weeks.  I took my time reviewing materials and preparing to solve the problems they might present.  I am happy to say that the time and studies paid off.  *I was accepted into [Hack Reactor Remote](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta)!!!* I elected to enroll in the cohort that starts on Feb. 29th, 2016.

The past couple weeks I've been digging into the required pre-course materials including building my first web application in javascript! I'm enjoying every project and can't wait to start working and learning with others next month.  I am so thankful for the opportunity to attend Hack Reactor's Remote program! It includes all the content and methodology from the on-site, but instead creates a virtual classroom and will give me just a little more time to connect with my wife and kids throughout each week.

So far, I'm in an ever-growing cohort of students from all over the US, London, and even Japan. We have been asked to rewrite part of a library of functions, write a simple clone of a well-known web-app, and implement a couple challenging functions using recursion.  There have been lots of helpful tutorials, slides, and links to get us ready for the first week.  The goal of the pre-course is to make sure we are all on the same page and I'm really excited to see where we progress from there! I have a decent idea of some of what the first week may include, but anticipate that even that first week will be challenging and surprising.

Each week, I hope to share a little more of what I'm learning and my favorite new resource, aside from the stuff you have to pay Hack Reactor to see ;-) .

This week, I'll stick to the announcement, but will share my favorite new resource. One of my classmates sent me [this video on recursion](https://youtu.be/k7-N8R0-KY4).  It is hilarious and informative and I've already subscribed to his youtube channel.
