{ "title": "While Learning to Code...", "date": "2015-11-10" }%%%

Learning to code sometimes feels like an infinite loop. This week I finished my second attempt at a portfolio and worked my way through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/learn/web" target="_blank">Codecademy's HTML/CSS track</a> and their <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/learn/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript Track</a>. I also began the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript" target="_blank">Code School JavaScript Road Trip</a>.  I had already taken <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804" target="_blank">Udacity's JavaScript Basics</a>.  Why do I list all these courses?

Every time I repeated a study of a concept, especially when building objects or functions on my own, I found myself with stronger content retention.  This <a href="http://rdbruhn.github.io/" target="_blank">most recent attempt</a> at a portfolio page has helped me get faster and more efficient and building in HTML and CSS. I also picked up some new tricks.

As I continue this journey, I'm positive I am going to be repeating myself a lot, but this seems to be where the real learning is taking place.  This next week I'm continuing that strategy, but also venturing into new territory.  I'm currently reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a> and working through the exercises in each chapter.  I'll be moving into JQuery on Codecademy and moving further on the Code School JavaScript Track.

After all that, I'll be tackling a new project building my first JavaScript "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. I hope all this repetition will pay off. No really, I hope I'll get paid for it someday soon.
